# Vibe-Check Quiz Web App
The Vibe-Check web app is a playful and insightful quiz platform designed to assess and reflect a user's current vibe or personality energy.

# Purpose
   -As the name suggests, the goal is to check someone's vibe â€” to understand how they feel or resonate at a particular moment.
   -To achieve this, the app uses a thoughtfully curated set of questions that reflect mood, behavior, preferences, and personality traits.

# Approach
   -The app takes a questionnaire-based approach, where users go through a series of engaging multiple-choice questions.
   -Each answer option is mapped to a specific vibe category (e.g., Thinker, Calm Soul, Adventurer, Social Butterfly).
   -As users answer each question, their selections are tracked and analyzed.
   -A simple, scalable logic algorithm tallies the responses and determines the dominant vibe based on the most frequently chosen category.

ðŸ”§ Technical Overview
     Answers and results are processed and stored via a connected Node.js + Express backend and MongoDB database.
     The system is built to be scalable â€” adding more questions or modifying logic is easy and flexible.
     The front-end is built with React (Vite) + Tailwind CSS, ensuring a fast, responsive, and visually appealing user experience.
